Occipital: Extreme level 3 covering the squama, bordered by level 1 near sutures. ",scan 2x,yes,"This is the only specimen from Chicama; all others from Pachacamac. I suspect the sex is male, based on large mastoid processes and general robusticity, but nuchal line and brow ridge are unpronounced and sex is not noted in museum records.   I also suspect that this form of PH may not have the same etiology as the less impressive lesions observed on most adult crania. "
